## Todo React App

### Overview
The Todo React App is a simple yet powerful task management application built using React.js. This app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete, providing a user-friendly interface to manage daily activities effectively. 

### System Design
The application follows a component-based architecture typical of React.js applications. Key components include:

- **App Component**: The root component that manages the overall state and renders child components.
- **TodoList Component**: Displays the list of todos and manages the state of individual todo items.
- **TodoItem Component**: Represents each todo item with options to mark as complete or delete.
- **TodoForm Component**: A form for adding new todo items.

The state management is handled using React's `useState` hook, ensuring that the application is performant and easy to maintain. 

### Implementation
The app is implemented with the following key features:

1. **Add Todo**: Users can add a new todo item via the input form.
2. **Display Todos**: All todo items are displayed in a list, with completed items visually distinguished.
3. **Mark Complete**: Users can mark items as complete, toggling their status.
4. **Delete Todo**: Users can remove items from the list.
5. **Filter Todo**: Users can filter items from the list.

The application uses CSS for basic styling and ensures a responsive design suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.
